### COMPANY BASICS
**Company Name:** ChatFlow AI
**Industry:** Business Communication / SaaS
**Founded:** 2022
**Company Size:** 15 employees
**Website:** www.chatflow-ai.com

### MISSION & VISION
**Mission Statement:** We exist to give small business owners their time back by automating repetitive customer communication.

**Vision Statement:** A world where every business can provide instant, 24/7 customer service without burning out their team.

**Core Values:**
- Simplicity First - Complex solutions don't solve simple problems
- Human-Centered Tech - AI should enhance human connection, not replace it
- Honest Communication - No overpromising, no manipulation
- Small Business Champions - We serve the underdog, not enterprise

**Origin Story:** Our founder owned a small e-commerce business in Lagos and was drowning in WhatsApp messages. Spending 5+ hours daily answering "What are your hours?" and "Where's my order?" instead of growing the business. Built ChatFlow AI to solve his own problem. Now helping thousands of businesses globally.

### PRODUCT/SERVICE DETAILS
**Product/Service Name:** ChatFlow AI

**Category:** SaaS - WhatsApp Business Automation Platform

**One-Sentence Description:** AI-powered WhatsApp automation that handles 70-80% of customer messages instantly while routing complex questions to humans.

**The Problem It Solves:** Small businesses are drowning in repetitive customer messages on WhatsApp, spending 3-5 hours daily answering the same questions, leading to burnout, lost sales (slow responses), and inability to scale.

**How It Works:** Our AI learns your business by scanning your WhatsApp history, website, and FAQ. When customers message you, the AI instantly responds to common questions (hours, pricing, order status, etc.) and routes complex questions to you. You stay in control but save hours daily.

**Key Features:**
1. Instant AI responses to common questions
2. Smart routing (AI handles simple, human handles complex)
3. 24/7 availability
4. Multi-language support
5. Order tracking integration
6. Appointment scheduling
7. Analytics dashboard
8. Custom AI training on your business
9. WhatsApp Business API integration
10. Mobile app for monitoring

**Unique Differentiators:**
- Built FOR small businesses (not enterprise-focused)
- No technical skills required (unlike competitors)
- African market expertise (understands local business practices)
- Affordable pricing ($49-199/month vs. $500+ competitors)
- Setup in 24 hours vs. weeks for competitors

**Technology/Methodology:** GPT-4 based AI with custom training on client's specific business, integrated with WhatsApp Business API, cloud-hosted infrastructure.

3. **Why should they believe you?** (Proof points, not claims)
4. **What makes you different?** (Really different, not marketing different)
5. **Who should you turn away?** (Bad fits that waste everyone's time)
6. **What do people always ask?** (Common questions/objections)
